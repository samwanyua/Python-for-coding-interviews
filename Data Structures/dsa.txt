Arrays
- Ordered collection of data
- zero-based indexing
- time complexity:
    > read - O(1)
    > insert - O(N)
    > delete - O(N)
- arrays are stored in contiguous memory

Linked list
- store ordered list of elements
- time complexity:
       > read - O(n)
       > insert - O(1)
       > delete - O(1)
       > search - O(1)
